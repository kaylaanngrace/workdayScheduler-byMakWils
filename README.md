## DESCRIPTION


## LEARNED/LEARNING


## PROCESS/INSTALLTION
First, I cloned my starter code and initialized my local repo, then created and pushed it to my github remote repo. Then, I looked at my mock up and wire-framed the html page. After that, I started adding my elements and classes based off of my wire-frame and the css selectors. I also removed the moment.js script link and added luxon instead, for the date and time components. 

First, in the js file, I added a few variables to select elements from my HTML. Then I added the current date and time. To get the date and time to update without refreshing, I used a function around my DateTime variables and used setTimeout(updateDateTime, 1000).
