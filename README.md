## DESCRIPTION


## LEARNED/LEARNING


## PROCESS/INSTALLTION
First, I cloned my starter code and initialized my local repo, then created and pushed it to my github remote repo. Then, I looked at my mock up and wire-framed the html page. After that, I started adding my elements and classes based off of my wire-frame and the css selectors. I also removed the moment.js script link and added luxon instead, for the date and time components.
